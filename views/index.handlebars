<h3>Welcome to E-learn</h3>
<p>
  In the early days, e-learning received a bad press, as many people thought bringing computers into
  the classroom would remove that human element that some learners need, but as time has progressed,
   technology has developed,   and now we embrace smartphones and tablets in the classroom and office,
    as well as using a wealth of interactive designs that makes distance learning not only engaging for
     the users, but valuable as a lesson delivery medium.
